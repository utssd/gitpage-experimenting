## [](#header-2)About me

I study and research Physics. My research topic is Spintronics, which is the study of electron spins in solid state devices. Besides physics, I like literature, philosophy and mathematics. I am also an enthusiastic coder. I enjoy practicing Chinese calligraphy.

## [](#header-2)More about Spintronics

Solid state/condensed matter physics has been closely related to semiconductor applications. Magnetoresistive RAM (MRAM), which originated from Spintronics research, has been commercially available. MRAM uses magnetic states to encode information rather than charge status. Magnonics and Spin Wave applications have also been active Spintronics research fields recently.

This site is still under construction. As time moving on, I will classify my writings, projects or other forms of works here. 

## [](#header-2)On publishing

Back to Han Dynasty in ancient China (91 BC), when Sima Qian (司马迁) finished his great history book *Shiji* (*史记*), (or *Records of Grand Historian*), he decided to distribute copies to different mountain areas to avoid government control and lost due to fire, war or other accidents. The effort of researching, writing and preserving knowledge has been called career of famous mountains (名山事业) in China. 

Now everything moves to cloud, you can share information with others by a simple `git push`; database app can be initialized on Amazon AWS within a minute. To publish is so easy nowadays! 

Great thanks to GitHub Pages. A great place for static hosting.
